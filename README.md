Creating a miniblog website. Project 0 for WDI Week 2. Kanban board and user narrative written my personal Kanban on my desktop.

My overall idea is to have this be a blogging website targeted at game companies, developers and players. Game companies would use
this site as an advertisement board for their latest titles using articles, teaser trailers, clips etc. The players can subscribe to 
all of the AAA companies as well as the indie designers to keep up with the games in production. Additionally the developers at each 
company will have a separate profile which they can post status updates of the current stages of the games that they are working on.
The idea is to have a blog that caters to both the standard commercial side of game development as well as the more technical side.

Still do to: I ran into issues with the submit post function. Need to figure out what in the CSS is stopping the post from sending to 
the template. 

Once project is completed, I will still need to store posts, comments, and average ratings in a backend server. 
After that, display average ratings both per game and per developer profile. Add developer profile page and player 
profile page.
